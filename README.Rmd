## Introduction
edgarWebR provides an interface to access the [SEC's EDGAR
system](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm) for company
financial filings.

edgarWebR does *not* provide any functionality to extract financial data or
other information from filings, only the metadata and company information. For
processing of the financial data.

## EDGAR Tools

The EDGAR System provides a number of [tools](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm)
for filing and entity lookup and examination. As of v1.0, edgarWebR supports
all public search and browse interfaces.

*Search Interfaces:*

| Tool                          | URL                                                             | edgarWebR function(s) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Company                       | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html        | `company_search()`, `company_information()`, `company_details()`, `company_filings()` |
| Recent Filings                | https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent      | `latest_filings()` |
| Full Text                     | https://searchwww.sec.gov/EDGARFSClient/jsp/EDGAR_MainAccess.jsp | `full_text()` |
| Header Search                 | https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar                          | `header_search()` |
| Fund Disclosures              | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/prospectus.htm            | Use `company_search()` and specify the 'type' parameter as 485 |
| Fund Voting Records           | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/n-px.htm                  | Use `company_search()` and specify the 'type' parameter as 'N-PX' |
| Fund Search                   | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/mutualsearch.html         | `fund_search()`, `fund_fast_search()` |
| Var. Insurance Products       | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/vinsurancesearch.html     | `variable_insurance_search()`, `variable_insurance_fast_search()` |
| Confidential treatment orders | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/ctorders.htm              | Use `header_search()`, `company_search()`, `latest_filings()`, or `full_text()` and use form types 'CT ORDER'|
| Effectiveness notices         | https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=geteffect       | `effectiveness()` |
| CIK                           | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/cik.htm                   | `cik_search()` |
| Daily Filings                 | https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/currentevents.htm         | `current_events()` |
| Correspondence                | https://www.sec.gov/answers/edgarletters.htm                    | Use `header_search()`, `company_search()`, `latest_filings()`, or `full_text()` and use form types 'upload' or 'corresp'|

Once a filing is found via any of the above, there are a number of functions to
process the result -

 * `filing_documents()`
 * `filing_filers()`
 * `filing_funds()`
 * `filing_information()`
 * `filing_details()` - returns all 4 of the filing components in a list.

### Parsing Tools

While edgarWebR is primarily focused on providing an interface to the online
SEC tools, there are a few activities for handling filing documents for which
no current tools exist.

 * `parse_submission()` - takes a full submission SGML document and parses out
   component documents. Most of the time, the documents of interest in a
   particular submission will be online and accessible via
   `filing_documents()` - this function is to unpack the raw submission to get
   all the documents. You may also find it more efficient if you're regularly
   downloading all of the files in a given submission.
 * `parse_filing()` - Takes a HTML narrative filing and annotates each
   paragraph with item and part numbers.

### Data Sets

There is one dataset provided with edgarWebR - `sic_codes`, providing a
catalog of SIC codes and their hierarchy.

### URL Tools

There are also a number of utility functions to help construct useful URL's
once you have a company CIK, submission accession number or specific file.

  * `company_href()` for linking to the company page
  * `submission_index_href()` and its family of related functions for linking
    to a specific submission and file.
